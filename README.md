Curated list of values a programmer should have

## Motivation
What values does a software engineer should have in order to be excellent in accomplishing the tech goals he/she is required?
There are a lot of articles out there but not a single list *maintained by the community of thousands of programmers* that are able to offer PRs and insights to a source control list of such values. This is the goal of this repo:
Becoming a *standard* of engineering values companies and people can endorse.
Please feel free to PR and share.

## The list
1. Problem-solving oriented
1. Learn with curiosity

2. Articulate your mental model
1. Teach with compassion
2. Ship fast, sustainably
